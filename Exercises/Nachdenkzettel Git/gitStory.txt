Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away there was a thingamajig doing things thingamajigs do...
...this little thingamajig had a huge inner conflict because...
...it had severe heart problems...
...but the story gets even worse, the thingamajigs wife...
...didn't like java...
...was proven guilty of adultery...
... this broke the thingamajigs heart even more...
...and therefore they got divorced...
